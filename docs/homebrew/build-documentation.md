## Steps to Solder the Motor Connectors

1. **Prepare the Motor and Wires**  
   * Take the motor out of the box.  
   * Use a wire cutter to remove the original connectors.

2. **Strip the Wire Insulation**  
   * Use a wire stripper to remove about 3mm of insulation.  
   * Twine the exposed wire so no individual strands come loose.

3. **Prepare the Connector**  
   * Grab a male connector and place both the wire and connector on a soldering mat.  
   * Align the tip of the wire inside the connector so that the remaining insulation meets the end of the connector.  
   * Secure the wire and connector by using a heavy object to press down on the wire and another object to hold the connector in place.

4. **Prepare the Soldering Iron**
   * Turn on the fume extractor/fan and your solder iron
   * Set the soldering iron to **400°C (750°F)**.  
   * Clean the tip of the soldering iron and apply solder around it to tin the tip (*important*).

5. **Solder the Wire to the Connector**  
   * Press the iron at the point where the wire and connector meet.  
   * **Caution:** The iron should never touch the connector's end.  
   * Press the solder against the iron—it should melt immediately.  
   * Gently push the solder toward the iron to feed it into the joint.  
   * Continue feeding until there is enough molten solder to fully cover the wire and any gaps.  
   * **Caution:** Avoid getting solder on the outer surface of the connector.

6. **Check and Secure the Solder Joint**  
   * Lift the soldering iron and allow the solder to cool.  
   * If the result is unsatisfactory, repeat steps 5-6 to reshape or add more solder.  
   * Once properly soldered, let it cool and use pliers to grab the connector end and gently pull to test its strength.

7. **Apply Heat Shrink Tubing**  
   * Slide a heat shrink tube of proper diameter and length onto the connector.  
   * Pull it down to cover the circular bulge on the connector.  
   * Use a heat gun to shrink the tubing until it fully adheres to the joint.

8. **Repeat for Remaining Connectors**  
   * Follow steps 1-7 for all three connectors.  
   * Inspect the solder joints to ensure quality.

9. **Commission the Motor**  
   * Once all connectors are properly soldered and secured, the motor is ready for commissioning.

10. **Clean up**
   * Turn off devices
   * Dispose of all the litter
   * We use lead-free solder but we treat it as leaded, so don't forget to wash hands
