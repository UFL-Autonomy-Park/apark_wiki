# Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) Soldering Guide

The steps are similar to motor soldering, but **we are using female connectors instead**.

---

## 1. Prepare the ESC and Wires

- Take the ESC out of the box.
- **Do not remove insulation** unless re-soldering is necessary.
!!! warning
     Wires are shortâ€”try to get it right on the first attempt.

## 2. Prepare the Connector

- Grab a **female connector**.
- Place both the wire and connector on a soldering mat.
- Note that the **female connectors' end is different** than the male version.

- Align the wire tip inside the connector so the insulation meets the end of the connector.

- Use a heavy object to secure the wire, and another to hold the connector in place.

## 3. Prepare the Soldering Iron

- Turn on the **fume extractor** or fan.
- Set your soldering iron to **400Â°C (750Â°F)**.
- Clean the tip and **tin it** by applying solder before use.

## 4. Solder the Wire to the Connector

!!! warning
     Avoid touching the connectorâ€™s end with the iron.

- Press the iron where the wire and connector meet.
- Touch the solder to the ironâ€”it should melt immediately.
- Feed solder into the joint until it fully covers the wire and fills all gaps.

!!! warning
     Avoid soldering the outer surface of the connector.

## 5. Check and Secure the Solder Joint

- Remove the iron and allow the solder to cool.
- If unsatisfactory, reheat and add solder as needed.
- Use pliers to gently pull the connector and verify itâ€™s firmly attached.

## 6. Apply Heat Shrink Tubing

- Slide a correctly sized heat shrink tube over the joint.
- Position it to cover the connectorâ€™s circular bulge.

- Use a heat gun to shrink the tubing until itâ€™s snug.

## 7. Repeat for Remaining Connectors

- Repeat steps **2â€“6** for all **three ESC wires**.
- Inspect all solder joints for quality and consistency.

---

## 8. Commission the ESC

- Once all connectors are soldered and secured, the ESC is ready for commissioning.

## 9. Clean Up

- Turn off all equipment.
- Dispose of leftover materials.
- Although we use **lead-free solder**, treat it as **leaded**.  ðŸ§¼ **Wash your hands thoroughly.**
