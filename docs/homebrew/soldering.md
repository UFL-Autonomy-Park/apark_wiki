## Soldering Tutorial

## Personal Protective Equiment (PPE)

- Required: Fume extractor
- Optional: Mask, gloves, glasses

## Tools

- Lead-free solder
- Drone motor
- 3 male connectors
- Wire cutters
- Wire strippers
- Desoldering wick
- Work holder (e.g. helping hands)
- Pliers

## Procedure

1. Prepare the Soldering Iron
   - Use the largest soldering tip available (preferably knife-edge).
   - Unscrew and replace the current tip carefully, avoiding damage to the heating element.
   - Turn on the ventilation fan.
   - Set the soldering iron to 750°F (400°C) and wait for it to reach the temperature.
   - Tin the solder tip by flicking it in the brass wool, then place it in the holder.
2. Prepare the Workpiece
   - Cut off the male connector.
   - Strip the wire to about 0.125 inches. Use the 12-gauge knotch.
3. Solder the Connection
   - Position the wire into the male connector.
   - Have a partner hold the male connector with pliers (or use a work holder).
   - Touch the soldering iron tip to the workpiece and wire simultaneously.
   - Feed solder into the joint from the side. Feed faster than expected.
   - Aim for a smooth surface finish that contours the connector.
   - After soldering, gently tug the connector to ensure a secure connection.

## Safety

- Avoid inhaling fumes from burning flux (a polymer).
- Tie back hair and loose clothing.
- Always place the soldering iron in its holder when not in use.
- Do not touch the soldering iron unless unplugged and cooled for at least 5 minutes.
- Always turn off the soldering iron when walking away.
- Use pliers to hold workpieces, as they conduct heat quickly.
- Remove all flammable objects from the workspace.
- Remove smart watches.
- Do not use phones at the work station and without washing you hands to avoid spreading any metal or lead traces.

## Troubleshooting

- **Dirty soldering tip:** Re-tin the tip regularly.
- **Rough surface finish:** Use flux and apply heat from the side of the iron, not the tip.
- **Desoldering:** Lay the wick on the target area and apply heat from the side of the iron until solder liquefies.
- **Solder** not attaching: Hold the iron on the joint longer to heat all parts (workpiece, wire, and solder) evenly.
- **Excessive** errors: Cut the wire, strip, and start over.
- **White** surface finish: Caused by excessive heat. Solder faster.
- **Surface** imperfections (e.g., black or orange areas): Remelt and add solder or redo the joint completely.
