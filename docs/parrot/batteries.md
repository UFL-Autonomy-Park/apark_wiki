title: Batteries and Hardware Problems

Please keep track of hardware issues [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T_aoWurX7TgQnxDy4PkYVoud7mi2kMfjMBERAAXXbsc/edit?usp=drive_link).

This sheet includes one tab for keep tracking of batteries and one tab for the drone themselves. Please update it as new batteries come in and old ones are thrown out. If a certain Bebop is having WiFi issues, crashed, and so on, please document it.

!!! note
    The spreadsheet is owned by the Autonomy Park Google account. Please login there to update it or share it with your own Google account. Iit is view-only to everyone with the link.

As of writing this on August 21, 2025, none of the cycle counts or ages of the LiPos for the Parrot Bebops are known. The following advice is generally given.

!!! note
    Unfortunately, Parrot's proprietary chargers do not allow charging to storage voltages or even checking the battery voltage. This is why it's important to keep tabs on their age and cycles.

## LiPo Battery Safety

### Disposal
**Never** throw away old LiPos in the regular trash. Schedule an EHS waste pickup here [HERE](https://www.ehs.ufl.edu/forms/hazardous-waste-forms/). It will be a chemical waste pickup. You will need to be given a plastic bucket by EHS first before pickup. I believe you email **hwm@ehs.ufl.edu** for this.


### Charging and Discharging

* Never over-charge (>4.2V per cell).
* Never leave charging unattended.
* Always charge on a non-flammable surface with good ventilation.
* Never over-discharge (<3.0V per cell).
* Never charge a puffy, warm or damaged LiPo.

### Storage

#### Unused Duration

LiPo batteries should not be left unused for extended periods. It is advisable to use or charge them every **30 to 90 days** to prevent voltage drop and deterioration.

#### Full Charge Duration

Keeping LiPo batteries fully charged (4.2 volts per cell) for more than **2 to 3 days** is not recommended. Extended periods at full charge can lead to a reduction in capacity and overall battery lifespan.

#### Safe Storage Practices

Storage Charge: For long-term storage (more than a week), it is best to keep LiPo batteries at a **storage charge of 3.8 to 3.85 volts per cell**. This corresponds to a state of charge between **30% and 50%**, which minimizes stress on the internal chemistry. 

Frequency of Checks: If stored for several months, periodically check the battery voltage. If it drops below **3.7V per cell**, recharge it to the storage voltage to prevent irreversible damage.

### Fire Hazards

LiPo battery fires are a significant risk due to the highly flammable electrolyte and reactive materials within the cell. A runaway reaction can lead to a fire that is difficult to extinguish.

#### Fire Extinguisher Classes

Most common fire extinguishers (Class A, B, and C) are ineffective against LiPo fires.

* **Class A:** For ordinary combustibles (wood, paper).
* **Class B:** For flammable liquids and gases.
* **Class C:** For electrical fires.

A LiPo fire requires a **Class D** extinguisher, although these are not commonly available in buildings. Due to the difficulty in extinguishing a LiPo fire, a bucket of **sand** is the most widely recommended and effective household method for containment and extinguishment.

#### Emergency Protocol

If a LiPo battery fire occurs, the following steps are recommended:

1.  **Safety First:** Immediately call **911** and evacuate the area.
2.  **Extinguish if Possible:** Use a **bucket of sand** to smother the fire. **Do not use water**, as it can exacerbate the fire by causing a violent reaction with the molten lithium. A bucket of sand is highly effective for isolating the fire and absorbing the thermal energy.
3.  **Get Away:** If the fire cannot be contained, prioritize your safety and get away from the area immediately.
